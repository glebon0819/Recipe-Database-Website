        <br>
        VG Recipes was created in January 2017 by Gabriel Lebon and Victoria Burke. They are both six years old and live in San Diego together in a disgustingly, frustratingly large beachfront mansion with 32 butlers, eight pups, three cows, 12 parakeets, and one smol moose. Gabriel is a successful politician with a master&rsquo;s degree in being a Chicano American Welfare Sciences in the State of Nebraska. Victoria is a professional albino Chilean mule breeder with an extensive career in artisanal waterboarding. <span style="text-align: center"><img src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/YE368MYnljBJyCEfTdPnSGW1SLqTvDT8K2UknzLy8F-9ykNXK9wy7Z-p-GzECIbnmrvXCd3MV4gcpVhFpbq4Qm9FcYBdGiR8Y5i03619rymM-xgbDg6wiQWcDFjWGTqppALn1bU9" height="200"/><img src="/student/globalit/2016/04_03/assets/pictures/pasted image 0.png" height="200" alt=""/></span>

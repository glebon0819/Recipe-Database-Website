        VG Recipes™ was created in January 2017 by Gabriel Lebon and Victoria Burke. They are both six years old and live in Rangpur City, Bangladesh together in a disgustingly, frustratingly large beachfront mansion with 32 butlers, eight pups, three cows, 12 parakeets, and one smol moose. Gabriel is a successful politician with a master&rsquo;s degree in Chicano American Welfare Sciences from the prestigious DeVry University. Victoria is a professional albino Chilean mule breeder with an extensive career in artisanal waterboarding.
